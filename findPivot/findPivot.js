/*
I have an array of words that are mostly alphabetical, except they 
start somewhere in the middle of the alphabet, reach the end, and 
then start from the beginning of the alphabet. In other words, this 
is an alphabetically ordered array that has been "rotated." Write a 
function that returns the index of the pivot, or null if there is 
no pivot (meaning the entire list of words is in alphabetical order). 

Example: ['dog', 'eagle', 'falcon', 'apple', 'bear', 'cat']  => will return a pivot index of 3 for 'apple'

var findPivot = function(array, start, end) {
  //Todo: Complete me!
};
